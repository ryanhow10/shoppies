## Technical Requirements
1. Search results should come from OMDB's API ✅
2. Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film ✅
3. Updates to the search terms should update the result list ✅
4. Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list ✅
5. If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button ✅
6. Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations ✅

## Extra Features
7. Animations for page and lists ✅
8. Display error messages wiith content directly from the OMDB API for faulty queries ✅
9. Restart button once the user has nominated 5 movies ✅
10. Save nominations list on exit ✅

## Future Improvments
1. Every keystroke triggers an API request which can be costly. Potentially a form like approach could be taken where a user would submit a definite query to send with the request.
